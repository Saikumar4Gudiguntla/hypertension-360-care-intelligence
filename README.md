# Hypertension 360° Care Intelligence — Patient, Provider, Payer & Compliance Analytics

**One-line value:** End-to-end population health analytics framework analyzing hypertension care from clinical, operational, and compliance perspectives.  
**Domain:** Health Informatics / Population Health / Healthcare Analytics  
**Status:** Completed Analytical Project ✅

## Why this exists (Impact)

Chronic disease management suffers from fragmented clinical and administrative data.  
Healthcare teams struggle to understand:

- Who drives utilization?
- Where costs concentrate?
- Whether quality measures are met?

This project builds a 360° analytics view across patients, providers, payers, and compliance metrics.

---

## What it does

- ✅ Defines hypertension cohort from synthetic EHR data (3,168 patients)
- ✅ Engineers patient-level analytic features
- ✅ Segments utilization risk bands
- ✅ Analyzes provider care delivery patterns
- ✅ Estimates payer cost exposure
- ✅ Calculates blood pressure control quality metrics

## Architecture (High Level)

Synthetic EHR Data → Cohort Definition → Feature Engineering  
→ Utilization Segmentation → Cost Analysis → Quality Measure Calculation  
→ Analytics-ready Outputs

---

## Tech Stack

- Python (pandas, NumPy)
- CSV-based analytics pipelines
- CLI workflows
- Git/GitHub

---

## Analytics Logic

- Diagnosis-driven cohort creation
- Encounter-based utilization segmentation
- Cost proxy modeling
- Clinical quality measure (SBP <140 / DBP <90)

---

## Outputs

- Patient-level hypertension dataset
- Provider utilization summaries
- Payer cost analysis tables
- BP control compliance reports

---

## Healthcare Impact

- Identifies high-utilization hypertension patients
- Highlights outpatient vs inpatient care patterns
- Surfaces potential care gaps and health equity signals

---

## Author Perspective

This project demonstrates how informatics thinking connects clinical outcomes, operational workflows, payer insights, and compliance reporting into one unified analytical view.
